# UChicago Trading Competition Quickstart
# Getting Started

A quickstart workspace is supplied for competitors to clone when they begin developing their strategies. This repo includes a sample implementation of each case (under /src) and sample workspaces for the Eclipse (.project) and IntelliJ (.idea) IDEs.

The contents of this repository are identical to the .zip file in the Dropbox folder provided. Therefore, if you are not comfortable with git, the same code is available through Dropbox.
