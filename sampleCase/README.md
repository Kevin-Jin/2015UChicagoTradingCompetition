============

Internal source repo for the 2015 University of Chicago Competition.  We will use this repo to track internal progress for developing the interfaces and samples for each case.

Please make sure you follow the general structure of the existing repo.  Please check files in under the respective case and name sub-folders of your case with intuitive names.  I will palce some common folders under each case: src, market-data, instruments, etc.  These will like be common to all cases and therefore make it easy for everyone to find the relevant materials.
